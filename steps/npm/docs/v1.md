# Run an NPM command

This step container runs an [NPM command](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli-documentation/). An NPM step with no configuration will run `npm test` using the default settings as set by NPM. You can define any flags on a command; those listed in the step specifications are only suggestions.

## Specifications
